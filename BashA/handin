part 1- 
chmod u-rw Alpha (You can't read or write to the file)
chmod g+r Alpha (The group can read it)
chmod o+w Alpha (The rest of the world can write to it)

part 2- 
No, it doesn't mean that you get them anyway. The Alpha file is still not readable or writable by the user even if the group can read and write on it.

Yes, now that we've changed the settings for Alpha where the group can read, write and execute others should be able to write to my Alpha file.
